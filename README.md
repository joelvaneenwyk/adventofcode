# Advent of Code

This stores my solutions to Advent of Code for 2017. I'll be using Haskell to address these. Word of extreme CAUTION: having not used Haskell in years I expect the code to be rather unpleasant to read for active users. You have been warned.

## Setup

### Windows

1. Install https://www.haskell.org/platform/
2. Install https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/
    * Note this is needed for VSCode integration
